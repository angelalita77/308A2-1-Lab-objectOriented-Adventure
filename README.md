# GLAB 308A.2.1: An Object-Oriented Adventure

### Introduction
This guided activity walks you through the process of creating a simple adventuring game using object-oriented programming principles. We will begin with basic concepts and the structure of the game, and then refine that structure with classes and other programming patterns.

### Objectives
- Combine objects, arrays, and functions.
- Use nested arrays and objects.
- Create a class to define the blueprint for creating objects.
- Add methods to a class.
- Set properties on an instance of a class.
- Make an instance of each class customizable.
- Create methods to alter the properties of an instance.
- Develop a class that inherits attributes from a "parent" class.
- Create static properties for a class.
- Create a "factory."

### Instructions
Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder and create a JavaScript file to contain your code. Within your code editor of choice, follow along with the steps below to create the adventure game. Feel free to take creative liberty with your own game!
Commit frequently! Every time something works, you should commit it. Remember, you can always go back to a previous commit if something breaks.
